- Primary color: A natural, muted olive green (#95A63F) for a grounded and adventurous feel, reflecting outdoor exploration.
- Background color: A soft, almost white with a subtle hint of green (#F3F4F0), evoking open spaces and natural light in a light scheme.
- Accent color: A warm golden yellow (#E4BA67) for highlighting key elements and call-to-action buttons, symbolizing sunshine and discovery.
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, slightly technical yet clean header style. Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and highly readable content throughout the application.
- Use clean, minimalist outline icons with consistent stroke weight for navigation, map markers, image previews, and administrative controls to ensure a modern and uncluttered look.
- Employ a clean and spacious layout. The homepage will feature a dominant, interactive map. Detail pages will have an embedded map at the top, followed by a scrollable content area. Ensure full responsiveness across all device sizes for optimal viewing.
- Implement subtle and fluid animations for map interactions, marker clicks, image gallery transitions, and page navigation to provide a seamless and engaging user experience without distractions.
